# OSRS Ironman Beginner's Guide

Welcome, brave adventurer, to the world of Old School RuneScape (OSRS) as an Ironman! As an Ironman, you'll embark on a self-sufficient journey through Gielinor, relying solely on your wits, skills, and determination—no trading or Grand Exchange handouts here! This guide is designed to introduce you to the game's core mechanics, teach you how to progress efficiently, and set exciting, achievable goals with clear endpoints. Whether you're slaying monsters, completing quests, or gathering resources, I'll make sure you're having a blast while learning the ropes.

Think of this as your adventurer's handbook—a roadmap to get you started, unlock key features, and feel like a true Ironman hero. I've taken inspiration from the detailed path you provided but simplified it for beginners, focusing on fun, exploration, and foundational skills. Each section has a clear goal, like unlocking a teleport or earning a shiny new cape, to keep you motivated. Let's dive into the world of RuneScape together!
